We are locally owned and operated and have had our roots in the Chippewa Valley for more than 30 years. With over 20 years experience in the low voltage field we have been fortunate enough to see the digital era come to life. This, combined with our background in construction, gives us our expertise to see “behind the walls” and to provide a level of custom video and sound installations to meet everyone’s requirements. From the HDTV at the end of the bed or the speakers over the master bath whirlpool tub to a full blown home movie theater, we can produce the design, products and installations to make your desires a reality.
